# Overview
This repository contains fictional (but closely approximated to real-world data) visualizations of both low and high-frequency raw data, as well as calculated EddyPro data, collected from six forest and peatland eddy covariance towers in Estonia. The fictional data is used to protect the original data, which is the property of the University of Tartu.
This repository does not include the Python scripts for half-hourly and daily data downloads from the SQL server, nor the R scripts for data calculations and visualization. If you'd like to receive these directly or request access to the private repository, please contact me via email at svyatoslav.rogozin@gmail.com or svatoslav.rogozin@ut.ee.

**The result of this project is the [Stations and Pulse dashboards](https://svyatoslav-stack.github.io/EcoEddyFluxDashboards/).**
